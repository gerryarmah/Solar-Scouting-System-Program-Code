# Solar-Scouting-System-Program-Code

**Solar Scouting System using Raspberry Pi Pico W.**
A lightweight solar monitoring system built with the Raspberry Pi Pico W that measures real-time solar panel voltage, displays it on an I2C LCD, and logs the data to a .csv file for later analysis. The system also uses an LED as a visual indicator during readings, making it perfect for basic environmental data collection or educational demos on IoT, ADC, and low-power embedded systems.

**Features:**
Reads analog voltage from a solar panel via ADC pin

Displays real-time voltage on a 16x2 I2C LCD

Logs timestamped voltage data to voltage_data.csv

Blinks an onboard LED with each reading cycle

Uses MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico W

**Ideal For:**
Solar efficiency tracking experiments

Learning how to use ADC with MicroPython

Building low-cost environmental monitoring stations

Raspberry Pi and IoT educational projects
